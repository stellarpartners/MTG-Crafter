## Technical Decisions Made
1. Data Storage
   - Using JSON files for raw data
   - Implementing versioning through metadata
   - Caching data with update checks
   - Alphabetical sorting for consistent storage

2. API Integration
   - Using rate limiting (100ms between requests)
   - Implementing proper error handling
   - Saving raw data for offline processing

3. Data Organization
   - Keywords stored with rules text
   - Ability words tracked separately
   - Card data preserved in original order
   - Metadata files alphabetically sorted

## Current Challenges
1. Data Management
   - Need to handle set rotations
   - Need to track card updates
   - Need to implement periodic updates

2. Performance
   - Large JSON files might need optimization
   - Might need to implement database for better querying

3. Keyword Processing
   - Some keywords missing from rules text
   - Need to handle keyword variants
   - Need to track keyword relationships

## Questions to Address
1. Data Processing
   - How to efficiently process card relationships?
   - How to identify synergies automatically?
   - How to handle card variations?

2. Updates
   - How often should we check for updates?
   - How to handle partial updates?
   - How to manage data migrations?

3. Keyword Analysis
   - How to identify keyword synergies?
   - How to track keyword evolution across sets?
   - How to use keywords for deck recommendations?
