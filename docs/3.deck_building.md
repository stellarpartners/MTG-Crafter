# Deck Building System

## Overview
The deck building system (`3.build_deck.py`) uses AI and machine learning to suggest thematic and synergistic decks.

## Core Components

### 1. Theme Learner
- Discovers themes from card text
- Uses pattern recognition
- Identifies mechanical synergies
- Maps theme relationships

### 2. Semantic Analyzer
- BERT-based text analysis
- Sentence transformer embeddings
- Synergy scoring
- Theme classification

### 3. Deck Suggester
- Color identity validation
- Card categorization
- Synergy optimization
- Theme coherence

## Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. Text Processing
- Tokenization
- Embedding generation
- Semantic similarity
- Pattern matching

### 2. Theme Detection
```python
# Example themes detected
themes = {
    'sacrifice': ['dies', 'sacrifice', 'graveyard'],
    'counters': ['+1/+1', 'proliferate', 'adapt'],
    'graveyard': ['return', 'exile', 'flashback'],
}
```

### 3. Card Categorization
- Commander (1 card)
- Core (25 cards)
- Support (35 cards)
- Utility (25 cards)
- Lands (14 cards)

## Usage

### Building a Deck
```bash
python 3.build_deck.py
```

Options:
1. Build around a card
   - Enter commander name
   - AI analyzes themes
   - Get suggestions

2. Build from colors/themes
   - Choose colors
   - Select themes
   - Get recommendations

### Output Formats
- JSON deck list (full card details and metadata)
- CSV format (card names, categories, and scores)
- Moxfield format (simple card list - one card per line)

## Technical Details

### Theme Analysis
- Semantic similarity scoring
- Mechanical pattern detection
- Keyword analysis
- Synergy mapping

### Card Selection
- Color identity filtering
- Theme coherence scoring
- Role-based categorization
- Synergy optimization

### Export Formats
- JSON: Detailed deck output with metadata
- CSV: Tabular card list
- Moxfield: Simplified format for direct import

### File Management
- Automatic file naming with timestamps
- Organized by color and theme
- Cache system for quick access
- Multiple format support

### Performance Optimization
- GPU acceleration
- Batch processing
- Cached embeddings
- Precomputed analyses
