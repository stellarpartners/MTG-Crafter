# Feature Plan: Pattern Learning from Popular Decks

## Overview
The "Pattern Learning from Popular Decks" feature aims to analyze and extract frequent card patterns and synergies from a large dataset of popular decks. By understanding which card combinations, archetypes, and strategies perform well, our system can improve deck suggestions by incorporating data-driven insights.

## Problem Statement
While our current deck building engine leverages semantic analysis and mechanical pattern recognition from individual card texts, we lack a mechanism to learn from entire decks that have proven successful. This gap may cause us to miss out on emergent strategies or synergies that occur only when considering the full deck context. Developing a feature that automatically learns prevalent card relationships and patterns from popular decklists will enhance our suggestion engine.

## Goals & Objectives
- **Insight Extraction:** Identify and learn recurring combinations of cards, card archetypes, and thematic synergies found in popular decks.
- **Enhanced Synergy Scoring:** Incorporate learned patterns into our deck suggestion engine to boost synergy scores for cards that belong to proven patterns.
- **Data-Driven Adjustments:** Allow the model to dynamically adjust to meta changes by periodically ingesting and processing newly collected popular decklists.
- **User Feedback:** Provide an explanation mechanism so users can understand why specific card combinations are suggested (e.g., "This card is often paired with X and Y in popular Golgari decks").

## High-Level Approach
1. **Data Collection & Curation:**
   - Gather decklists from reputable sources (tournaments, community submissions, online repositories).
   - Standardize deck data by ensuring consistent naming and categorization.
   - Periodically update and validate the deck dataset.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Extract features such as card frequency, card groupings, deck archetypes, mana curves, and role distributions.
   - Utilize techniques like frequent itemset mining (e.g., Apriori, FP-growth) to identify recurring card combinations.
   - Consider signal factors like card synergy, overall deck performance, and meta relevance.

3. **Pattern Learning & Model Integration:**
   - Apply association rule mining and clustering algorithms to extract latent patterns.
   - Experiment with unsupervised learning to identify clusters of decks sharing similar characteristics.
   - Integrate the learned patterns with the current theme network and synergy scoring modules.
   - Weight cards or card combinations based on their appearance frequency and known performance metrics.

4. **Evaluation & Iteration:**
   - Validate the patterns against known successful decks and prototypes.
   - Gather qualitative feedback from power users and community experts.
   - Iterate on the feature extraction and integration processes to refine accuracy.

5. **User Interface & Explanation:**
   - Update the deck builder UI to display insights drawn from pattern learning.
   - Offer visualizations or summary notes indicating why certain card combinations are recommended.
   - Provide a toggle for users to view "pattern insights" alongside deck suggestions.

## Key Milestones
- **Milestone 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing**
  - Identify and curate decklists from at least 3 major sources.
  - Clean, standardize, and store deck data in the database.
  
- **Milestone 2: Feature Extraction Implementation**
  - Develop initial scripts for mining frequent item sets from the decklists.
  - Experiment with clustering algorithms to aggregate deck archetypes.
  
- **Milestone 3: Pattern Learning Integration**
  - Integrate learned patterns into the current AI engine.
  - Modify synergy scoring to incorporate pattern frequency data.
  
- **Milestone 4: UI & User Interaction**
  - Update the UI to display pattern-based insights.
  - Implement user feedback collection on the quality of pattern-based suggestions.

- **Milestone 5: Evaluation and Optimization**
  - Perform A/B testing comparing the current engine against the updated model.
  - Optimize extraction algorithms based on performance and accuracy.

## Timeline & Resource Estimates
- **Phase 1 (2-3 Weeks):** Data collection and initial feature extraction development.
- **Phase 2 (3-4 Weeks):** Prototype pattern learning module and integrate into synergy scoring.
- **Phase 3 (2 Weeks):** UI modifications and user feedback collection.
- **Phase 4 (2 Weeks):** Testing, bug fixes, performance optimizations, and documentation updates.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Data Quality:** Inconsistent or noisy decklist data may affect pattern accuracy.
  - *Mitigation:* Implement rigorous data cleaning procedures and use multiple sources.
- **Computational Complexity:** Mining large datasets can be resource-intensive.
  - *Mitigation:* Use batch processing, caching, and consider incremental updates.
- **Overfitting to Meta:** Patterns might become outdated with shifts in the meta.
  - *Mitigation:* Ensure regular updates and incorporate adaptive learning mechanisms.
- **User Comprehension:** Advanced patterns might be hard for users to understand.
  - *Mitigation:* Provide clear visualizations and plain language explanations in the UI.

## Success Metrics
- **Improvement in Synergy Scores:** Measure the increase in overall deck synergy/calculated scores.
- **User Feedback:** Collect user surveys and qualitative feedback on deck suggestions.
- **Adoption Rates:** Track feature usage and compare generated deck popularity before and after integration.
- **Performance:** Ensure the pattern learning module runs within acceptable time and resource limits.

## Conclusion
By leveraging data from popular decks, this feature aims to refine our deck suggestions with a data-driven approach. Achieving this will not only add value to our existing deck building engine but also provide a competitive edge in deck optimization and strategy within the Magic: The Gathering community.
