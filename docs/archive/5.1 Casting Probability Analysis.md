# Casting Probability Analysis

## Overview
The casting probability analyzer simulates multiple games to determine:
1. When cards can be cast (earliest possible turn)
2. How reliably cards can be cast (percentage of games)
3. The mana curve progression through early game

## Key Features

### Game Simulation
- Simulates first 10 turns of gameplay
- Tracks land drops and mana availability
- Considers mana sources (lands and rocks)
- Prioritizes playing mana sources over other spells

### Statistics Tracked
- Draw probability per card
- Cast probability per card
- Average casting turn
- Earliest possible casting turn
- Problem cards (never cast)
- Sample game logs

### Sample Game Analysis
- Records 3 sample games (start, middle, end of simulation set)
- Shows detailed turn-by-turn actions
- Tracks mana development
- Shows casting decisions
